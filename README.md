# Data Structures 2 Syllabus

## Description
This syllabus covers a comprehensive curriculum of data structures and algorithms, starting from the basics of CLI and Java programming, moving on to object-oriented programming, and culminating in advanced topics such as dynamic programming and graph algorithms. The course is designed to provide hands-on experience with implementing various data structures such as linked lists, arrays, trees, and graphs, as well as various algorithms for searching, sorting, and manipulating data.

Throughout the syllabus, students will be exposed to a range of programming challenges and projects, including the implementation of a tic-tac-toe game, a phone number factory, and an arcade application, all while using the concepts and techniques covered in class.

Additionally, the syllabus also covers advanced topics such as minimum spanning trees, maximum flow and minimum cut, dynamic programming techniques for solving problems such as the longest increasing subsequence and coin change, and advanced sorting and search algorithms.

The final project of the course involves the implementation of a pathfinding algorithm, providing students with a real-world application of the concepts they have learned.

In conclusion, this syllabus provides a comprehensive education in data structures and algorithms, with a strong emphasis on practical implementation and real-world applications.
